- This project was created for my independent learning module - 2021. 

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME

***!!WARNING!!***
- When you start playing the game, the sound effects are very loud, please turn them down using the volume mixer on your computer.

As there are quite a few files within this repisitory it may be confusing as to how to start the game. 
In order to run the game you need to follow these steps:

1. You need to download this entire repisitory as a zip file
2. Unzip the contents into a folder of your choosing
3. Import the folder into a Python IDE, such as Visual Studio Code
4. Once you have done that, you need to open the file called 'alien_invasion.py'
5. Then run that file within the IDE and that should open the pygame interface.
6. It will come up with a 'PLAY' button which you will need to click 
7. To be able to move the ship around you need to use the left & right arrow keys. To shoot the fleet you need to use space bar. 
8. To quit the game, you need to either press 'q' on your keyboard, or simply use exit out with the 'x' at the top right of the interface. 

- The numbers displayed on the right, reading from top to bottom is the high score and level of the game
- As the levels increase, the movement of the alien fleet becomes faster

- The number in the centre will contain your highest score, and will be updated whenever you play again
- The images of the space ship on the left refers to the lives left
