# ALIEN INVASION
- Made using Crash Course Python, 1st Edition. 
- This project was created for my independent learning module - 2021. 

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME

***!!WARNING!!***
- When you start playing the game, the sound effects are very loud, please turn them down using the volume mixer on your computer.

As there are quite a few files within this repository it may be confusing as to how to start the game. 
In order to run the game you need to follow these steps:

1. You need to download this entire repository as a zip file. This can be located above the repository in the green box labelled 'code'. Click on the last option to 'Download ZIP file'. 
2. Unzip the contents into a folder of your choosing
3. Import the folder into a Python IDE, such as Visual Studio Code. The IDE is a Intergrated Development Enviroment, if you do not have one of these, you can download them online to install on your computer. 
4. Once you have done that, you need to open the file called 'alien_invasion.py' within the folder in your IDE. 
5. Then run that file within the IDE and that should open the pygame interface.
6. It will come up with a 'PLAY' button which you will need to click or double click. 
7. To be able to move the ship around you need to use the left & right arrow keys. To shoot the fleet you need to use space bar. 
8. To quit the game, you need to either press 'q' on your keyboard, or simply use exit out with the 'x' at the top right of the interface if using Windows OS.
If you're having troubel exiting the game, possibly due to your operating system, you may need to enter 'exit', 'quit' in the terminal or USE Crtl-D to exit the game.

- The numbers displayed on the right, reading from top to bottom is the high score and level of the game
- As the levels increase, the movement of the alien fleet becomes faster

- The number in the centre will contain your highest score, and will be updated whenever you play again as long you don't exit the interface. Otherwise the high score goes back to zero upon exiting. 
- The images of the space ship on the left refers to the lives left

- The images and sound effects used in this project, can be found in their respective folders within the repository.  

Thank you for trying out my first project!
